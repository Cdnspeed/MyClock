# Contributing Guide

1. Fork the repo → create a branch per stage or feature.
2. Follow the staged plan; keep commits scoped.
3. Run local build (`arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3 src`).
4. Ensure CI passes before PR.
5. Open a Pull Request → include stage and test card results.

Naming: `feature/stage3-time-sync` etc.
